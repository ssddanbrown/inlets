## Intro

inlets&reg; combines a reverse proxy and websocket tunnels to expose your internal and development endpoints to the public Internet via an exit-server. An exit-server may be a 5-10 USD VPS or any other computer with an IPv4 IP address. You can also tunnel services without exposing them on the Internet, making inlets a suitable replacement for a VPN.

Why do we need this project? Similar tools such as [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) or [Argo Tunnel](https://developers.cloudflare.com/argo-tunnel/) from [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) are closed-source, have limits built-in, can work out expensive, and have limited support for arm/arm64. Ngrok is also often banned by corporate firewall policies meaning it can be unusable. Other open-source tunnel tools are designed to only set up a single static tunnel. inlets aims to dynamically bind and discover your local services to DNS entries with automated TLS certificates to a public IP address over a websocket tunnel.

When combined with SSL - inlets can be used with any corporate HTTP proxy which supports `CONNECT`.

## License & terms

**Important**

Developers wishing to use inlets within a corporate network are advised to seek approval from their administrators or management before using the tool. By downloading, using, or distributing inlets, you agree to the [LICENSE](./LICENSE) terms & conditions. No warranty or liability is provided.

### Backlog & goals

#### Completed

* automatically create endpoints on exit-server based upon client definitions
  * multiplex sites on same port and websocket through the use of DNS / host entries
* link encryption using SSL over websockets (`wss://`)
* authentication for server and client
* automatic reconnect
* native multi-arch with ARMHF/ARM64 support
* Dockerfile and Kubernetes YAML files
* discover and implement `Service` type of `LoadBalancer` for Kubernetes - [inlets-operator](https://github.com/inlets/inlets-operator)
* tunnelling websockets
* [get a logo for the project](https://github.com/inlets/inlets/issues/46)
* TLS certificates when used with a reverse proxy, or inlets PRO

#### inlets PRO

The following features / use-cases are covered by [inlets PRO](https://inlets.dev):

* Tunnel L4 TCP traffic such as websockets, databases, reverse proxies, remote desktop and SSH
* Expose multiple ports from the same client - i.e. 80 and 443
* Run a reverse proxy or Kubernetes IngressController directly on your host
* Automated TLS for the control-plane
* Commercial services & support
* Documentation, blog posts, tutorials and videos

### Status

Unlike HTTP 1.1 which follows a synchronous request/response model websockets use an asynchronous pub/sub model for sending and receiving messages. This presents a challenge for tunneling a *synchronous protocol* over an *asynchronous bus*.

inlets 2.0 introduces performance enhancements and leverages parts of the Kubernetes and Rancher API. It uses the same tunnelling packages that enable node-to-node communication in [Rancher's k3s project](https://k3s.io). It is suitable for development and may be useful in production. Before deploying `inlets` into production, it is advised that you do adequate testing.

Feel free to open issues if you have comments, suggestions or contributions.

* The tunnel link is secured via `--token` flag using a shared secret
* The default configuration uses websockets without SSL `ws://`, but to enable encryption you could enable SSL `wss://`
* A timeout for requests can be configured via args on the server
* ~~The upstream URL has to be configured on both server and client until a discovery or service advertisement mechanism is added~~ The client can advertise upstream URLs, which it can serve
* The tunnel transport is wrapped by default which strips CORS headers from responses, but you can disable it with the `--disable-transport-wrapping` flag on the server

### inlets projects

inlets is a Cloud Native Tunnel and is [listed on the Cloud Native Landscape](https://landscape.cncf.io/category=service-proxy&format=card-mode&grouping=category&sort=stars) under *Service Proxies*.

* [inlets PRO](https://inlets.dev) - Cloud Native Tunnel - TCP, HTTP & websockets with automated TLS encryption
* [inlets-operator](https://github.com/inlets/inlets-operator) - Public IPs for your private Kubernetes Services and CRD
* [inletsctl](https://github.com/inlets/inletsctl) - The fastest way to create self-hosted exit-servers
* [inlets](https://github.com/inlets/inlets) - Cloud Native Tunnel for HTTP only - configure TLS separately, not available for inletsctl or inlets-operator

## Get inlets

You can install the CLI with a `curl` utility script, `brew` or by downloading the binary from the releases page. Once installed you'll get the `inlets` command.

### Install the CLI

> Note: `inlets` is made available free-of-charge, but you can support its ongoing development and sign up for updates through [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/alexellis/) 💪

Utility script with `curl`:

```bash
# Install to local directory
curl -sLS https://get.inlets.dev | sh

# Install to /usr/local/bin/
curl -sLS https://get.inlets.dev | sudo sh
```

Via `brew`:

```bash
brew install inlets
```

> Note: the `brew` distribution is maintained by the brew team, so it may lag a little behind the GitHub release.

Binaries are made available on the [releases page](https://github.com/inlets/inlets/releases) for Linux (x86_64, armhf & arm64), Windows (experimental), and for Darwin (MacOS). You will also find SHA checksums available if you want to verify your download.

Windows users are encouraged to use [git bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads) to install the inlets binary.

## Using inlets

### Video demo

Using inlets I was able to set up a public endpoint (with a custom domain name) for my JavaScript & Webpack [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
